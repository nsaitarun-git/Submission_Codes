# Auditoryâ€“Tactile Congruence for Synthesis of Adaptive Pain Expressions in RoboPatients

## About the Study

This repository contains the experiment codes and raw data for a study conducted to evaluate perceptual congruence between palpation and the corresponding auditory output. We conducted this study with 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain intensity through sound. We provide the codes used for analysis in this repository as well.

## Programming Languages 

- **MATLAB**: We used MATLAB for conducting the experiments and for recording the experiment data. Additionally, we performed some of our analysis with MATLAB.
- **Python**: We used Python for performing some of our analysis.
